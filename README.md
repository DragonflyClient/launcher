# Dragonfly Launcher

An Electron application that handles the launch process of the Dragonfly client. It
activates the Dragonfly Agent for injecting the source code and
downloads the required assets from the Minecraft or Dragonfly
servers.

## How to use the launcher

**!** Make sure to copy the content of the [`dragonfly`](dragonfly) directory into the `.minecraft/dragonfly` folder!

This folder contains important assets and binaries that are required by the Dragonfly Launcher
in order to start the Minecraft game.
